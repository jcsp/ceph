Thank you for opening a pull request!

Please make sure all your git commit messages include a "Signed-off-by" line,
and a "Fixes" line as appropriate.  This is the format for
commit messages:

"""
[component]: [short description]

[A longer multiline description]

Fixes: [ticket URL on tracker.ceph.com]
Signed-off-by: [Your Name] <[your email]>
"""

The component is the short name of a major daemon or subsystem,
something like "mon", "osd", "mds", "rbd, "rgw", etc. For ceph-mgr modules,
give the component as "mgr/<module name>" rather than a path into pybind.

For more examples, simply use "git log" and look at some historical commits.
